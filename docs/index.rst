Welcome to sst1mpipe's documentation!
=====================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

The **sst1mpipe** repository is used for processing and analyzing data from 
the SST-1M prototype. Currently, two SST-1M telescopes are installed in Ondrejov, 
Czech Republic, operation in both mono and stereo observation modes.

**sst1mpipe** provides tools for low-level data analysis up to DL3, which can be 
further analyzed using standard tools such as `gammapy <https://github.com/gammapy>`_.
